### :bug: Fixes
- [#1846](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog/issues/1846) Unexpected error
  exit code when using `-reporter=github-[pr-]check` with
  `-fail-on-error=true`. See the below breaking changes section for more details.
- [#1867](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog/pull/1867) Tool name was incorrect for github-[pr-]check reporters and check API does not work correctly for project config based run
- [#1867](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog/pull/1867) Deletion of outdated comment didn't work properly with github-pr-review reporter since tool name isn't correctly configured for project config based run

### :rotating_light: Breaking changes
- [#1858](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog/pull/1858) Remove original_output from rdjson/rdjsonl reporters' output

### :rotating_light: Deprecation Warnings
- [#1854](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog/pull/1854) (Actually No Breaking changes) `-fail-on-error`
  flag is deprecated. Use `-fail-level=[none,any,error,warning,info]` flag
  instead. You can reproduce the same behavior with `-fail-level=any` for most
  reporters (reviewdog will exit with 1 if it find any severity level).
  As for `github-[pr-]check` reporter you can reproduce the same behavior with
  `-fail-level=error` ([#1846](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog/issues/1846)).

  `-fail-on-error` is just deprecated and it's not removed yet. Please update
  the flag while it's working.
<!-- TODO: update the v0.19.0 release section -->

## [v0.20.1] - 2024-07-14

### :bug: Fixes
- [#1835](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog/pull/1835) Fix -filter-mode
  didn't work with github-[pr-]check reporter for graceful degradation cases.
  i.e. GitHub token doesn't have write permission (e.g. PR from forked repo).

## [v0.20.0] - 2024-07-07

This version is created by mistake and is the same as v0.19.0.
We left both versions as-is so that it won't break existing clients who already use v0.20.0.

## [v0.19.0] - 2024-07-07

### :rocket: Enhancements
- [#1804](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog/pull/1804) Support deleting
  outdated comments in github-pr-review reporter. Note that it won't delete
  comments if there is a reply considering there can be a meaningful
  discussion.
- [#1806](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog/pull/1806) Add
  -reporter=rdjson/rdjsonl which outputs rdjson/rdjsonl format to stdout. It
  also changes the default behavior of -diff and -filter-mode for local
  reporters. If -filter-mode is not provided (-filter-mode=default) and -diff
  flag is not provided, reviewdog automatically set -filter-mode=nofilter.
- [#1807](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog/pull/1807) Add -reporter=sarif
  which outputs SARIF format to stdout. You can upload the output SARIF to
  GitHub and see code scanning alerts.
- [#1809](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog/pull/1809) Support posting
  comments outside diff context as a file comment in github-pr-review reporter

### :rotating_light: Breaking changes
- [#1846](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog/issues/1846) the behavior of
  `-fail-on-error` changed with `-github-[pr-]check`. Previously, reviewdog
  didn't exit with 1 if it find issues with warning and info level. Now
  reviewdog will exit with 1 with any level.
  <!-- TODO: replace upcoming release with next released version -->
  The previous behavior can be restored with `-fail-level=error` flag with the
  upcoming release.

## [v0.10.0] - 2020-05-07

### :sparkles: Release Note

With v0.10.0 release, now reviewdog can find issues outside diff by controlling
filtering behavior with `-filter-mode`. Also, you can ensure to check reported
results by exit 1 with `-fail-on-error`.

Example
```shell
$ cd subdir/ && reviewdog -filter-mode=file -fail-on-error -reporter=github-pr-review
```

### :rocket: Enhancements
- [#446](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog/issues/446)
  Added `-fail-on-error` flag
  ([document](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog/tree/e359505275143ec85e9b114fc1ab4a4e91d04fb5#exit-codes))
  and improved exit code handling. ([@DmitryLanda](https://github.com/DmitryLanda), [@haya14busa])
- [#187](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog/issues/187)

  which controls how reviewdog filter results. ([@Le6ow5k1](https://github.com/Le6ow5k1), [@haya14busa])
