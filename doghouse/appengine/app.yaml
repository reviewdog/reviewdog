# Configure automatic scaling setting to reduce the running cost of the
# reviewdog server (doghouse server).
# The server should be mostly network I/O bound as it basically just calling
# GitHub APIs, so it should be safe to increase the scaling condition while
# preserving the performance.
#
# reviewdog CLI typically call multiple requests at the same time, so the
# default max_concurrent_requests (=10) seems to be too small and it can be a
# reason why AppEngine starts multiple instances for the reviewdog server.
#
# We can also limit the # of instances explicitly by max_instances and
# max_idle_instances, but this config doesn't use them just in case.
